                CBD is short for cannabidiol, one of over 100 cannabinoids found in the hemp plant. CBD, unlike THC, is
                non-psychoactive and won't get users high. Cannabidiol was actually discovered in the 1940s, but it
                wasn't until this past decade that CBD has eliminated its negative stigma of being associated with
                marijuana. Many medical professionals have even began recommending CBD to help patients cope with
                various health conditions. You can buy CBD in a number of different forms, including CBD tinctures, CBD
                gel caps and pills, CBD topical products and more.
